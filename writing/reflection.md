# Reflection: Rock, Paper, Scissors Lab

Please answer the following questions after you have completed the programming lab. Write your answers in complete sentences and provide thoughtful responses.

## Comprehension Questions

1. What is the purpose of breaking a program into functions? How did this help you in completing the lab?

Your Response:

The purpose is to make it easier to manage and also easier to correct. If something is going wrong on just one piece of code then you don't have to look through the entire program to fix it. It also allows you to conceptualize a lot easier because you only have to do one function at a time that interacts with the others in the main().


2. Describe how you validated user input in your version of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Why is input validation important?

Your Response:

Using a while loops helps to remove any errors if the input is incorrect. Then going through and allowing multiple answers and converting them makes the user experience cleaner. It also minimizes any problems with code later on.

3. How did you use comments and docstrings in your code? Give an example of a helpful comment or docstring you wrote.

Your Response:

The docstrings were mostly already written by the instructions that were given. However, I used one on the if statements in the main loop because I just input some code to prevent any errors for the ties. I also did it when I felt I did something that was just to help solve issues without actually modifying code.

4. Explain how the computer's move is generated in your program. What Python features did you use to accomplish this?

Your Response:

Using the random package, I am able to make a random selection from a list. This random selection is then assigned to the variable computer_choice which can then be used in other code after calling the function. 

5. What was the most challenging part of refactoring the spaghetti code into a more structured program? How did you overcome this challenge?

Your Response:

Realising which portions could actually be put into other functions. Even though there seemed to be several more functions I could've made, I decided to add some portions to others because I felt it was neater and better put together.

## Ethical Reflection Questions

1. Why is it important to write code that is easy for others to read and maintain? How does this relate to your responsibilities as a programmer?

Your Response:

TODO

2. Consider the use of open source code (like the spaghetti code provided). What are some ethical considerations when using, modifying, or sharing code written by others?

Your Response:

TODO
